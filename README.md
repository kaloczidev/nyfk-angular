# Angular 2 starter pack

This repo creates basic crud based on angular 2 frontend including: 

- Components
- Routing
- HTTP
- Interfaces
- webpack

with an express REST backend. 

## install

- Clone this repo with ssh `git clone git@github.com:kaloczidev/nyfk-angular.git` or with https: `git clone https://github.com/kaloczidev/nyfk-angular.git` .
- in the cloned folder run `npm i` to install depedencies.
- after the depedencies installed, build it with `npm run telepit`. 

## develop

Use the `npm run webpack` to make your angular source code re-builded when you make changes.

Start the REST backed with `npm run serve` . 

## notice 

when you change the server's code, make sure that you restarted your application to take changes.

webpack can be silly, don't afraid to restart the webpack process. 

Read the errors you get (console output!), it helps a lot.
